I ran into some Segfault errors (caused within the inOrder traversal)
and I cannot figure them out as of now.
-Lines 128 & 130 are known to cause segfault errors when questing
-for the root's left and right subtrees

I have emailed you asking for an extended deadline so that I can fix
the segfault issues.

Thank you again,
Jared Bumgardner
