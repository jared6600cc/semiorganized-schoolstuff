User's Manual

Setup & Compilation
1. Download & Unzip the submission from elearning on a linux box in the multi-platform lab.
2. Submission includes:
	-cityWeights.txt	(input file)
	-Functional_Decomposition.txt
	-main.c
	-makefile
	-results		(results from experiments)
	-User's_Manual.txt	(this)

3. Environment: I haven't tested this program in the multiplatform lab.

4. Compiling: This program includes a Makefile. At the command line in linux, type make.
	The program produces an executable entitled proj3

5. Running the program: Be sure all files are in the same directory. Issue command ./proj3
	No command line arguments are required or checked.

6. User Input: The program prompts the user for the following
	-Number of cities (integer)
	-Tours in a generation (integer)
	-Number of generations (integer)
	-Mutations per generation (double decimal < 1)

7. Output: All output goes to console.
	Example:
		*OUTPUT*
	Cities run: 4
	Optimal cost (brute force):
	Time (brute force): 0 seconds 2 microseconds
	Cost (Gen.Alg.):
	Time (Gen.Alg.): 0 seconds 0 microseconds
	% of optimal produced by Gen.Alg.:
