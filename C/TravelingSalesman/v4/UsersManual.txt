Data Structures & Algorithms 2
Project 3
Users Manual

Setup & Compilation:
1. Download and unzip the submission from eLearning on a Linux box in the multi-platform lab.
2. The submission includes:
	-FunctionalDecomposition.txt
	-UsersManual.txt (this file)
	-cityWeights.txt (Contains edge weights for city graph)
	-main.c
	-makefile
3. Environment: This program has not been tested in the multi-platform lab but will probably compile there.
4. Compiling: This program includes a Makefile. at the command line in Linux, type make. This program produces an executable entitled proj3.exe

Running the Program:
Have all files in the same folder. Issue command ./proj3. No command line arguments are required or checked.

Output: All output goes to the console. Output will be similar to this.
