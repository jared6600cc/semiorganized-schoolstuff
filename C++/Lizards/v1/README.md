NOTE: I had to change some of the code in the provided lizard.cpp file BECAUSE he wrote srandom() and random()...which doesn't seem to exist in c++. It had to be changed to srand() & rand(). This was in sections labeled as complete so if you know of a way to use / find srandom() and random() then it'd probably be good to change it back. Added comments on these lines in the format specified in Project PDF.
